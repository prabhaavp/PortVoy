PortVoy makes network scanning easy. It checks your network interface, then scans the port you decide to connect. With a simple interface and no data collection, you can scan, find, and connect all with this app. It also features a “Setting” where you can save servers frequently connected to.


**Option 1: (Recommended)**  
[Join the PortVoy Google Group: https://groups.google.com/u/3/g/portvoy](https://groups.google.com/u/3/g/portvoy)

2. Participate as a tester!  
   - Communication will only occur if absolutely necessary for updates related to the testing process.  
   - This group is strictly for preview purposes.

**Option 2:**  
Download the files as a zip, open them in Android Studio, and compile an APK.

### FAQs

**Why do I need to join this group?**  
Google requires developers to add pre-release testers' email addresses. By joining, you'll automatically get access—much easier than having me add each person individually. Once you've joined, visit the link below to download the beta. You may also be asked to provide feedback on the app through Google, which will be forwarded to me.

**Why isn’t the app public?**  
Google mandates 20 testers for 14 days before the app can go public. Once we have enough testers, this step won’t be necessary!

**Why don't you just provide the APK?**  
It's more consistent to get apps from a trusted source. Most Android phones have the Play Store pre-installed, making it a familiar and safe option.
